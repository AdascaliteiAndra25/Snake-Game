"# Snake" 
This project implements the Snake game using x86 assembly language in a flat, stdcall architecture. 
The game displays a snake that moves across the screen, collecting food to grow in length while avoiding obstacles. 
Graphics are rendered using an external library, and the game logic includes collision handling, keyboard input management, and continuous position updates. The code utilizes procedures for drawing objects, processing user input, and updating the game state at each time interval.
